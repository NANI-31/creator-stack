# UI/UX Recommendations

## Design Aesthetic

- **Premium Creator Look**: Focus on high-quality typography (Inter/Outfit) and subtle gradients.
- **Glassmorphism**: Use semi-transparent backgrounds for cards and modals to create depth.
- **Micro-animations**: Subtle hover transitions on tool cards and vote buttons.

## Key Screens

- **Discovery Grid**: A masonary or balanced grid of tool cards. Cards should show:
  - Tool Logo/Thumbnail.
  - Name & Short Description.
  - Quick Vote buttons.
  - Category tags.
- **Tool Detail Page**:
  - Prominent "Visit Website" button.
  - Sidebars for "Related Tools" or "Author Info".
- **Submission Flow**: Simple, step-by-step form to prevent abandonment.

## User Experience

- **Frictionless Voting**: Allow voting without leaving the discovery grid (AJAX-based).
- **Search & Filter**: Real-time filtering by category and instant search.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Ensure the grid and navigation are seamless on mobile devices.
