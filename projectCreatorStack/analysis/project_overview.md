# Project Overview: CreatorStack

## Concept

CreatorStack is a curated discovery platform dedicated to "lesser-known" but highly useful websites and tools for creative professionals. It aims to solve the problem of information overload by providing a quality-first, community-vetted directory.

## Value Proposition

- **Curation over Quantity**: Instead of listing every tool, it focuses on hidden gems.
- **niche Focus**: Categorization by professional roles (Web Dev, UI/UX, etc.) ensures relevance.
- **Community Driven**: Ranking and quality are determined by those who use the tools daily.

## Key Stakeholders

- **Guests**: Users looking for inspiration or tools.
- **Contributors**: Professionals sharing their discoveries.
- **Administrators**: Ensuring quality and managing categorization.
